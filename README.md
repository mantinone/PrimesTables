# PrimesTables
A programming test!

You must have Node and npm to run this project.  Clone the repo, then navigate to the PrimesTables folder.

To run the tests, just enter `npm test` in the command line.  To print out the multiplication table of the first ten primes, enter `npm run primesTable`, or `node ./src/primesTable.js`



### The project contains three functions.

`checkPrimes( number )` takes any integer and returns true if it's prime and false if it isn't (or false if it's an invalid input)

`nPrimes( n )` takes any positive integer n and returns the first n prime numbers.

`timesTable( array )` takes any array of numbers and prints out a multiplication table with those numbers.
